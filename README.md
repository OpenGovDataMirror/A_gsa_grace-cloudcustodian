## <a name="description">Description</a>
The code provided within this subcomponent will create the AWS resource required for the implementation of several policies utilizing the [Cloud Custodian](https://cloudcustodian.io) serverless rules engine. Cloud Custodian is an open source tool developed by Capital One to help provide automated governance, security, compliance, and cost optimization to their cloud environments. The grace-cloudcustodian subcomponent focuses on providing policies around IAM user managment and helps to cover several Security Controls dealing with Identification and Authentication.

>NOTE: Additional information reagarding the usage and configuration of Cloud Custodian can be found [here](https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian)

## <a name="usage">Usage</a>

To use the Cloud Custodian terraform module to deploy custom policies as lambda functions, you will be required to download the  binary release from Github.

[top](#top)

### Example Usage

To apply custodian policies to a single AWS account to which the Lambda function is deployed,
include the following in your root terraform module:

```
module "example_grace_cc" {
  source    = "github.com/GSA/grace-cloudcustodian?ref=v0.1.2"
  appenv    = "development"
  sender    = "validated-sender@your.org"
  recipient = "validated-recipient@your.org"
  kms_key_id = "c6af3dc4-0247-4638-a85d-892b8e66c754"
}
```

## <a name="security">Security Compliance</a>
The GRACE Cloud Custodian subcomponent provides various levels of coverage for several [NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Rev. 4) Security Controls](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/impact/moderate).  These security controls are designated for [FIPS 199 Moderate Impact Systems](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.199.pdf). Additional information regarding the implementation method utilized can be found within the [GRACE Component Control Coverage Repository](https://github.com/GSA/grace-ssp/blob/master/README.md).

**Subcomponent approval status:** `Pending Assessment`

**Relevant controls:**

| Control Description | Control ID |
|-|:-:|
| Access Controls | [AC-2](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AC-2), [AC-2(1)](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AC-2#enhancement-1), [AC-2(4)](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AC-2#enhancement-4)  |
| Identification and Authentication Controls | [IA-4](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IA-4), [IA-5](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IA-5), [IA-5(1)](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IA-5#enhancement-1) |
